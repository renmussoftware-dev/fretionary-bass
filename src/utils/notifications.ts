/**
 * Local notification helpers — no remote push infrastructure (no APNs/FCM
 * server, no remote push entitlements). Just scheduled local notifications
 * that fire on the device.
 *
 * Currently powers the streak-protection reminder: each time the app
 * launches, we cancel any pending reminder and schedule a new one for
 * the next day at REMINDER_HOUR (local time). If the user opens the app
 * before then, we cancel + reschedule with the latest streak count. If
 * they don't, the notification fires and nudges them not to break their
 * streak.
 *
 * Permission flow: maybeRequestPushPermission() is the manual ask. It returns
 * true if the user granted (or had previously granted). We gate the ask
 * on engagement (called from app/_layout.tsx after the user crosses the
 * favorites threshold) so it doesn't fire on cold launch.
